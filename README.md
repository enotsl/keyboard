Firmware for 60% keyboards
===========================

* Written in Arduino on the Teensy 3.1
* Support for a primitive Alt-GR (simulates CTRL+ALT)
* Strongly inspired by the [Shatenzo Keyboard Firmware](https://github.com/BFoerschner/Shatenzo-Keyboard-Firmware)
* Easy to understand, easy to edit
